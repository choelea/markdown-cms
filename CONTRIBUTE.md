==========

We do our best to accept all PRs that help advance the project.  
Thanks for your contributions!

## Process

1) Open a Pull Request against the `dev` branch
2) Ensure all tests pass in the PR with TravisCI (and hopefully you added a few tests too?)
3) Wait for review and discussion. Do poke us if a few days elapse to remind us.
4) Your code will be merged if accepted!

## Reasons for PR Rejection

a) PR not created against `dev` branch ([Here's How](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-pull-request-on-github#create-pull-request))
b) Tests are failing according to TravisCI on supported Node versions
